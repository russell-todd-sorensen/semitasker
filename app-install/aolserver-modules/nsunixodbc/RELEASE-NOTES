Initial Release:
 This module was adapated from the nssolid module.
 A few comments in the .c file indicate I couldn't figure out what
FAR or SS_FAR were intended to do. They lead to errors during compile,
so I removed them. 
 The module compiles with a lot of warnings about different arg widths.
They appear to be different names for 'unsigned small int' so I couldn't
figure out what the problem was here either. At any rate, the problem is
in the unixodbc usage, not in nsunixodbc.c, which just adopts the usage.
 Stored Procedures are not supported.
 Bind variables are not supported as in ora8 or emulated as in nspostgres.
