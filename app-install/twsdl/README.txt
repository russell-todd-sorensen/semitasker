What are these files?

twist-x.y.z.tar.gz -->

 tWSDL and TWiST source code which runs under Tcl version 8.4+ and/or
  AOLserver 4.01+.

 Each file is a copy of the subversion tag with the corresponding name
  minus the .tar.gz.

 Users can also use the subversion command:
  $ svn checkout http://twsdl.googlecode.com/svn/tags/twist-x.y.z twist-x.y.z

 
twist-x.y.z.r.apm 

 A very thin OpenACS package which helps install and manage the tWSDL/TWiST
  source code. This package uses subversion for installation and updates.

 Updating to a new version of TWiST only requires changing the version number
  in the OpenACS application instance.

 OpenACS users only need the latest version of this file to install TWiST.
