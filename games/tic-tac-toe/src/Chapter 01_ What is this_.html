<div class="cat">The Model Component
 <div class="body">
 <p>In <code class="para-term">Tic-Tac-Toe</code> the Model
 component is what distinguishes the internal and external 
 state of objects in a system. By this definition, two objects
 with the same Model are the same object. Unlike the concept
 in Object Oriented Programming, objects do not have behaviors.
 Instead objects are containers for data which in total 
 constitute the object's Model. An object is totally defined
 by the associated data. This is a very dynamic definition
 of an object, but is clearly more natural than the rigid
 boundaries usually applied to objects. With rigid boundaries,
 certain object data ends up separated from the object as a
 pooled, collective property. Sometimes these are called 
 sub-types. </p>
