 <div class="body">
 <p>Originally <code class="para-term">Tic-Tac-Toe</code> was developed as an aid to implementing
 the Model-View-Controller design pattern. However, there is much
 confusion in this area, and simply using the phrase without an
 extensive discussion of how <code class="para-term">Tic-Tac-Toe</code> is intended to fit into this
 pattern may lead many developers to false assumptions.</p>

 <p>In reviewing most of the template engines available to developers
 it is notable that the View component is somehow required to enforce
 the separation between the Model and itself. </p>

 <p>Pointing out the obvious: this is the responsibility of the
 Controller. Failure to appreciate this fact easily leads to the design 
 of View components which are unsafe or are too tied to the specific 
 controller. </p>
 
 <p>One example of tying the View to the Controller is the StringTemplate
 template engine. This engine is touted at extreme separation between
 Model and View. The View cannot change the Model. However, nowhere in the
 analysis of the MVC pattern is there any mention of the Controller. The 
 problem with the analysis is that the StringTemplate Controller must
 specialize the data to fit the template. Data specialization is a View
 function. Basically: Model stores, Controller selects, View formats for
 display. If there is any actual connection between the View and the Model
 which allows the View to modify the Model, this is not good. But if the
 Controller provides direct write access to the Model, blame the
 Controller. What the Controller should do is to provide values derived
 from the model. What the View does with those values should not have a
 direct lasting effect on the Model.</p>
