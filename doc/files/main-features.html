<h2><a name="what_is_naviserver?">What is NaviServer?</a></h2>
<p>

NaviServer is a World Wide Web server that provides access control and
database connections and runs on multiple UNIX platforms. NaviServer
can access SQL databases including Sybase, SOLID, Postgres, and some
third-party database drivers.


<p>


NaviServer is extendable with both C and Tcl APIs that expose core
functions and provide primitives for accessing the database. NaviServer
also provides optional CGI support, although the C and Tcl APIs are
more powerful, offer superior performance, and are easier to use.


<p>


You can configure multiple servers within one NaviServer configuration
file, and then specify which server to run when you run NaviServer.
NaviServer also uses a multi-threaded design on all supported
platforms. You can configure the number of threads each server can
use.


<p>


NaviServer offers direct connections to SQL databases such as Postgres, Sybase, MS SQLServer.
Third-party database drivers are provided for Oracle, Informix, and Interbase. You
can even configure NaviServer to have connections to multiple databases
and specify which databases are available to each server.


<p>


NaviServer also includes server administration capabilities. An access
control system allows you to specify separate permissions for each
combination of URL and HTTP method (GET, PUT, or POST). You can also
specify users and groups who are allowed access to NaviServer.


<p>

 NaviServer Administration Features


<p>


<ul>

<li> Access Control:


<br><br>


     NaviServer's access control system allows you to define users, assign
     users to groups, and set permissions for users, groups, and hosts.


<br><br>


     When defining permissions for the NaviServer, you can specify lists of
     users to allow or disallow, lists of groups to allow or disallow, and
     hosts (specified either by host name or IP address) to allow or
     disallow for each method/URL combination..


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> Multi-homing:


<br><br>


     NaviServer allows you to run multiple servers on one host by attaching
     them to different port and/or IP address combinations.


<br><br>


     See the &quot;Configuration for Multiple IP Addresses&quot; section for
     information on configuring NaviServer for multi-homing.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> Database Services Features


<br><br>


     NaviServer manages pools of open connections to databases. These pools
     let NaviServer quickly service simultaneous database requests (without
     continuously opening and closing the database), and to prevent a large
     number of HTTP requests from overloading the system. Both the Tcl and
     C APIs provide access to these database pools.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> Programming Interface Features


<br><br>


     <br><br>
<li> Tcl Interface:


<br><br>


     NaviServer can be extended using the Tcl scripting language. NaviServer
     provides a powerful Tcl API containing a full array of functions and
     primitives that give you access to all of NaviServer's core
     functionality and SQL databases. Tcl functions are available to
     interact with the connection, implement scheduled procedures, maintain
     state, access the sockets and threads interfaces, roll access logs,
     maintain permissions, access the database, and much more.


<br><br>


     You can create scripts in a private Tcl library for each server, or in
     a library shared by multiple servers. Since Tcl is embedded in
     NaviServer, a separate process is not required to run a Tcl script,
     making Tcl extensions much more efficient than CGI-based extensions.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> NaviServer Dynamic Pages (ADPs)


<br><br>


     ADPs allow you to embed Tcl scripts directly into HTML pages. The
     script(s) are interpreted dynamically when the page is accessed.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> C Interface:


<br><br>


     NaviServer can also be extended with the C API. The C API lets you
     write your own logging routines, access control system, communications
     drivers, or database drivers. It provides all the necessary functions
     and structures you need to access NaviServer's core functionality and
     the database.


<br><br>


     To use the C API, you compile your C module into a Unix shared
     library. NaviServer will dynamically load the module and call your
     initialization function.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> CGI Support, Including CGI File Type Activation:


<br><br>


     NaviServer provides full CGI support. Because running a CGI program
     requires a separate process to be created, it is less efficient than
     extending NaviServer with Tcl or C.


<br><br>


     You can configure NaviServer to look for CGI programs in a specific
     directory, or you can store CGI programs near the HTML files and refer
     to them using the .cgi file type. Any file with the .cgi extension
     will be interpreted as a CGI program by NaviServer. You can configure
     NaviServer to activate the .cgi file type in specific directories or
     groups of directories.


</ul>



<p>


<h3><a name="high_performance">High Performance</a></h3>
<p>

Fast and efficient handling of simultaneous connections through a combination
of multi-threading, in-memory caching, and single-threaded asynchronous I/O.

NaviServer has an advanced multithreaded architecture.  Multithreading
features include:

<ul>

<li>Fast response without having to fork for each connection.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Multiple, simultaneous servicing of connections.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Ability to keep state in the address space of the single
    NaviServer process - no need to maintain slow and messy external
    files!


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Simple programming model where each request is handled in its own
    thread, freeing the programmer from the worry of a long running
    request blocking the server.

<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Fully configurable minimum and maximum number of threads on a
    per-virtual server basis. Threads are transparently added when
    demand rises and then slowly exit as demand falls.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>The Tcl interface is fully multi-threaded aware - no special steps
    are required to ensure proper concurrent script evaluation.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>The nsthread platform-independent C API for multithreaded programming which
    includes:

    <br><br>
<ul>

    <li>Functions to create and wait for new threads

    <br><br>
<li>Mutex, critical section, semaphore, and event objects to protect shared resources

    <br><br>
<li>Thread local storage for maintaining per-thread data


</ul>



<br><br>


<li>The nsthread interface allows the NaviServer programmer to write
    new C functions which use advanced multithreaded locking and
    synchronization techniques independent of the host platform. In
    fact, the NaviServer is written entirely using the nsthread
    interface - no platform specific multithreading code is used
    anywhere in the NaviServer or in any NaviServer module. No other Web
    server provides this level of multithreaded programming support!


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>NaviServer performs in-memory caching of pages and scripts, and
    single-threaded asynchronous I/O for returning static content.


<br><br>


</ul>


<h3><a name="tcl_scripting">Tcl Scripting</a></h3>
<p>

Quickly add dynamic content to your website:

<ul>

<li>Integrated multi-threaded interpreter runs scripts in parallel in one process
    with complete access to server state

<br><br>
<li>NaviServer Dynamic Pages (ADP's) allow embedding of Tcl scripts in HTML pages

<br><br>
<li>Rich, easy-to-use scripting language loaded with new NaviServer-specific
    extensions for building web applications

<br><br>
<li>Ability to add your own C commands to the language


</ul>


NaviServer includes the Tcl (Tool Command Language) scripting language
as an integral part of its architecture:

<ul>

<li>The Tcl interface allows you to quickly build custom Web
    applications without C code or messy CGIs.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>The Tcl interface is multithreaded, allowing more than one Tcl
    script to operate in one or more virtual servers simultaneously.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Built-in Tcl scripts operate up to 10 times faster than comparable
    Perl-based CGIs.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>The Tcl interface can be extended to include your own custom Tcl
    commands written as Tcl procedures or as C primitives.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>NaviServer extends Tcl to include commands for accessing one more
    open databases without writing any C code or executing slow
    external CGIs.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>The Tcl interface includes useful commands for accessing HTML form
    data and information about the active connection.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>The Tcl interface provides a command for opening a TCP/IP socket
    which can be used to implement a quick HTTP transaction to another
    Web server or send Email using SMTP (a procedure for sending email
    is included).


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Resources allocated during evaluation of a Tcl script (e.g., open
    database handles, open files, ns_Set data) are automatically
    garbage collected after the script returns, freeing the script
    developer of these tedious tasks.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Tcl scripts can be in the pages directory along with the HTML
    pages and images or in a special Tcl library directory:


<br><br>


    <br><br>
<ul>

    <li>Scripts in the pages directory are evaluated on each
        transaction which is ideal for quick script development.

    <br><br>
<li>Scripts in the library directories are evaluated at startup
        time for fast response without having to open and read the
        script file.


</ul>



<br><br>


<li>NaviServer includes an HTML-forms based interface for creating and
    updating Tcl scripts which are located in the Tcl library
    directory. Also included is a simple HTML form for ad-hoc
    evaluation of a Tcl script typed directly into a text area box.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Tcl, unlike Java, has been in use by a large user community for
    years (join the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup) and is well documented by
    the creator of Tcl, John Ousterhout of Sun Microsystems.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>NaviServer Dynamic Pages (ADP's) are HTML pages that are parsed and
    run on the server when the page is accessed -- ADPs contain HTML
    tags and Tcl scripts.  ADPs are ideal in situations where you want
    to generate part or all of a specific page dynamically.


<br><br>



</ul>



<p>


<h3><a name="complete_c_api">Complete C API</a></h3>
<p>

Write custom dynamically loaded modules for:

<ul>

<li>Handling requests

<br><br>
<li>Translating URLs

<br><br>
<li>Logging

<br><br>
<li>Database access

<br><br>
<li>Thread creation and synchronization

<br><br>
<li>And much more!


</ul>



The NaviServer includes a complete C API. Using the C API you can write:

<ul>

<li>Custom request functions to handle HTTP request to an URL or a
    complete hierarchy of URLs.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Custom URL-to-file translation routines to convert an HTTP URL to
    a file in the local filesystem. This can be used to map URLs to
    one or more filesystem directories as required for maintenance or
    load balancing.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>New Tcl commands for use in your Tcl scripts. NaviServer provides
    initialization functions to ensure your command is available in
    all the Tcl interpreters in a virtual server Tcl interpreter pool.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Database drivers to interface NaviServer to your own DBMS.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Communications drivers so NaviServer can implement HTTP over a new
    underlying protocol:

   <br><br>
<ul>

   <li>The included nssock module implements HTTP over
       regular TCP/IP sockets just like other basic Web servers such
       as NCSA, CERN, or WebSite.


<br><br>


   <br><br>
<li>Filter functions which run at any stage of each HTTP request. A
       filter can be used to implement logging - in fact, this is how the
       nslog Common Log Format logging module works.


<br><br>


   <br><br>
<li>A scheduled procedure which runs at regular intervals. A scheduled
       procedure can be used in conjunction with a filter function to
       implement a statistics gathering system.


<br><br>



</ul>



</ul>



<p>


No other Web server C API is as complete and powerful as the NaviServer
C API!


<p>


<h3><a name="sql_database_services">SQL Database Services</a></h3>
<p>

Powerful and easy access to a variety of SQL databases. Driver source
for PostgreSQL and Sybase/MSSQLServer are included with others available from third
parties.


<p>

NaviServer includes loads of features to help you connect your website
to SQL databases:

<ul>

<li>Provides a platform independent interface to SQL relational databases.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Connects to underlying database servers through plug-in database
    drivers:


<br><br>


    <br><br>
<ul>

    <li>Included are drivers for Sybase, MS SQLserver, and PostgreSQL.


<br><br>


    <br><br>
<li>The NaviServer/AOLserver Communities have also contributed drivers for
        Informix, Oracle, Interbase, and MySQL.


<br><br>



</ul>


<li>NaviServer maintains one or more pools with one or
    more open database connections. By maintaining open connections,
    HTTP requests have instant access to the database instead of
    incurring the expensive startup time of a CGI-based solution.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Requests are queued in first in, first out order to ensure
    efficient and fair use of database resources.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li>Database operations are available through both the C and Tcl API's.


<br><br>



</ul>
