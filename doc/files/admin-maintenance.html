<br><br>

     Run in command (interactive) mode, when started Tcl shell will be provided 
     same way as tclsh

</ul>


<h3><a name="using_watchdog">Using Watchdog</a></h3>
<p>

NaviServer now has implemented a quite useful <em>watchdog</em> feature that allows the server to
restart if it fails. In many situations you are now freed from setting up a special way of
handling a server failure that would be solved with a simple restart.

<p>
Just start the server with the new <em>-w</em> switch.

<p>
Technically speaking the nsd process is forked twice and the first forked instance
(the watchdog) controls the second (the worker). The first instance reacts on exit
codes and signals caught during the watch and correspondingly restarts the second instance.

<p>

<em>Restarting the Server</em>

To restart the server from within your TCL code:

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>

ns_shutdown -restart

</pre></td></tr></table></p>

To restart the server from the shell you can send the server the SIGINT.

<p>

<em>Pro:</em>

<ul>

<li> Builtin feature. No need to setup something else.
<br><br>
<li> Ability to restart from within your application. 

</ul>

<em>Con:</em>

<ul>

<li> First step of implementation. You may need more options for the watchdog as
         it offers you now.

</ul>

<p>

<h3><a name="other_approaches">Other approaches</a></h3>
<p>

There are several ways to keep your server running. Depending on your particular
requirements the watchdog may not be the right thing for you. Common approaches are listed below.

<em>Using init with /etc/inittab</em>

<p>

Very easy to setup but with it's own limitations. init is the parent of all processes.
It creates processes from the script /etc/inittab. Add a line like

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>

ns1:345:respawn:/usr/local/ns/bin/nsd -i -u nsadmin -g users -t /usr/local/ns/config.tcl

</pre></td></tr></table></p>

and init does the job of restarting the server if it crashes.

<em>Pro:</em>

<ul>

<li> Very easy to configure.
<br><br>
<li> Some kind of built in feature of your OS. 

</ul>

<em>Con:</em>

<ul>

<li> You need to be root to edit /etc/inittab and make changes.
<br><br>
<li> If there's an error during startup init tries to restart the server and then waits for some time. Repeats endlessly.
<br><br>
<li> There's no simple way to just stop the server if you want to as init tries to keep it up. 

</ul>

<h3><a name="using_cron">Using cron</a></h3>
<p>

As you already have (or may have) a rc-script for starting your server during boot
time you simply could run a cronjob that checks the status of something like

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>

rcnaviserver status || rcnaviserver start

</pre></td></tr></table></p>

as part of a script every 5 minutes by adding a crontab line (crontab -e) like

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>

*/5 * * * *		/root/cronjobs/nsd_crontab

</pre></td></tr></table></p>


<em>Pro:</em>

<ul>

<li> If you wrap the status check in your own script you are more flexible in choosing the right action for the job, e.g. E-Mail notifications.
<br><br>
<li> Works fine if you don't have a requirement of virtually no downtime. 

</ul>

<em>Con:</em>

<ul>

<li> Slightly more work if you have the situation to just stop the server for maintenance etc. (E.g. just restart if a certain status file does not exist)
<br><br>
<li> You have to touch at least three files: the rc-script, crontab list and restart script. 

</ul>


<h3><a name="using_daemontools">Using daemontools</a></h3>
<p>

Daemontools is a collection of software to controll other processes.

<p>

<em>Pro:</em>

<ul>

<li> Allows more users to control the process, e.g. users of a specific group. 

</ul>

<em>Con:</em>

<ul>

<li> Extra package, you need to compile it.
<br><br>
<li> You need to be root. 

</ul>

<h3><a name="running_as_root">Running As root</a></h3>
<p>

<em>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WEBSERVER USAGE.</em>

The situations where you might want to run NaviServer as user root are rare to none.
But NaviServer as a tool is so flexible that it can not only be used as webserver.
It's possible (and has been done) to use it as some kind of application where serving
webpages is not the primary target.

<p>
So it's possible to tell NaviServer to run as root using the -u switch at startup from the commandline.

<p>
Of course, you have to be root to do that:

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>

./nsd -f -u root -g www -t ../sample-config.tcl

</pre></td></tr></table></p>

You can see the result in the security info:

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
...
[-main-] Notice: nsmain: NaviServer/4.99.0 starting
[-main-] Notice: nsmain: security info: uid=0, euid=0, gid=8, egid=8
...
</pre></td></tr></table></p>

It's simply a convenience for people that need it to not have to rewrite code to achieve this. 

<h3><a name="running_inside_chroot_environment">Running inside Chroot Environment</a></h3>
<p>

Chrooting Naviserver effectively means to run it with a special root directory.
When using TCL commands like file, glob or exec only files &quot;below&quot; the specified
path are visible, limiting access to critical files and devices. This is an important
means to limit the access attackers of a website might gain.

<p>
You don't have to use the command line chroot command (see man page), NaviServer comes with built-in chroot capability.

<p>

There are scripts available (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsdinstallers) with the intention
to simplify and speed up the task of creating a chroot environment.

<p>

<em>Benefits</em>

<ul>

<li> Usually strong barrier for attackers
<br><br>
<li> Access to the filesystem is limited
<br><br>
<li> Hopefully limits the damage of previously unknown, new security holes 

</ul>


<em>Disadvantages</em>

<ul>

<li> The setup of a chroot cage is a cumbersome task, you have to find out every library used, absolute paths might be compiled into the code, strace will become your friend...
<br><br>
<li> Every other application used (e.g. ImageMagick) must be chrooted
<br><br>
<li> When using a database network support must be enabled or the socket placed into the chroot environment (?)
<br><br>
<li> Updates and patches for Naviserver or any other chrooted tool becomes more difficult 

</ul>

<p>

<em>Alternatives</em>

Use Novell AppArmor (http://www.novell.com/products/apparmor/) and create a Profile for Naviserver 

<h3><a name="command_(interactive)_mode">Command (interactive) mode</a></h3>
<p>

Usually you start the server and it waits for signals. With testing in mind a new mode was
added for developers: The interactive 'Command mode'.

<p>
If you start NaviServer with

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>

   ./nsd -c &lt;other args&gt;

</pre></td></tr></table></p>

it runs a TCL shell and waits for commands. You are then able to do more comprehensive
tests than going the other way with using a TCL shell and loading libnsd.so.

<p>

<em>Note:</em>

<p>

This mode is not intended to be used for a production system. If you need insight on a running server
the Controlport might be the right thing for you.

<p>

Just a quick example: The server is started and two commands are issued, ns_info threads and ns_info requestprocs.

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>

<h3><a name="examples">Examples</a></h3>
<p>


<p>

<em>nsd -t nsd.tcl</em>

<p>

This is the simplest form of the command line.

<p>

<em>nsd -ft nsd.tcl</em>

<p>

NaviServer will be run in the foreground.

<p>

<em>nsd -fkt nsd.tcl -r /newroot</em>

<p>

NaviServer will be run in a chroot environment, and any
currently-running server will be killed.


<h2><a name="maintenance_tasks">Maintenance Tasks</a></h2>
<p>

An NaviServer installation requires regular maintenance as follows:

<p>

<ol>


<li> Make regular backups of pages and associated files for each virtual server.

<br><br>
<li> Make regular backups of the access log.

<br><br>
<li> Make regular backups of the server log, especially if verbose
       messages are enabled.

<br><br>
<li> Make regular backups of the Tcl directory(ies).

<br><br>
<li> Make regular backups of the bin directory, especially if you have
       customized loadable modules.

</ol>

<p>


Each of these maintenance tasks is described in the following sections.


<p>


<h2><a name="maintain_the_directories">Maintain the Directories</a></h2>
<p>

The NaviServer directories described below should be backed up
regularly to ensure against file system failure.


<p>


<h3><a name="back_up_the_pages_directory">Back Up the Pages Directory</a></h3>
<p>


The location of the pages directory for each virtual server is
determined by the server-specific PageDir entry in the NaviServer
configuration file. Normally, it is the /pages subdirectory under
the NaviServer home directory.


<p>


Use whatever file system backup procedure you have in place at your
site. To schedule nightly backups, use the Unix cron facility.


<p>


<h3><a name="back_up_the_access_log">Back Up the Access Log</a></h3>
<p>

The access log file needs to be backed up regularly. By default, the
access log for each virtual server is in the
/logs/access.log file under the NaviServer home directory.


<p>


The access log can be configured to limit the number of old logs
maintained (with the MaxBackup parameter). This sets an upper limit on
the amount of disk space the access logs take. However, because old
logs beyond the limit configured to be saved by the NaviServer are
deleted automatically, you must back up old logs if you require a
complete history of access to your site. For example, if the MaxBackup
parameter in the configuration file is set to 5, only five old access
log files will remain on disk. When a sixth log file needs to be
opened, the oldest log is removed.


<p>


<h3><a name="back_up_the_server_log">Back Up the Server Log</a></h3>
<p>

Ordinarily, the server log file grows at a slow rate and does not need
regular truncation. However, while debugging new applications, you
should set the Verbose parameter in the ns/module/nsdb/pool/pool-name
section in the configuration file to on instead of off (the
default). Every SQL statement sent to the database is logged in the
error log and causes the file to grow much more quickly. In this case
you may want to back up the error log.


<p>


<h3><a name="back_up_the_tcl_scripts_directory">Back Up the Tcl Scripts Directory</a></h3>
<p>

The Tcl scripts directory contains the source to the Tcl scripts that
provide the server with much of its advanced functionality. Tcl
scripts for each virtual server are stored in the
/tcl subdirectory by default, and global Tcl scripts are
stored in the /modules/tcl subdirectory by default.


<p>


If you write new Tcl scripts or edit the existing ones, you must
ensure your changes are saved regularly to a safe place. Also, be sure
that any external files utilized by your Tcl scripts are backed up
too, including files outside the NaviServer home directory.


<p>


<h3><a name="back_up_the_bin_directory">Back Up the bin Directory</a></h3>
<p>

The /bin subdirectory of the NaviServer home is the location of the
NaviServer binary and the default location of any dynamically loadable
C modules. If your site maintains several interesting loadable
modules, you must make sure copies of the modules are backed up to
avoid having to recompile them after a file system failure. Also, be
sure to back up your module source code.



<p>


<h2><a name="directory_map">Directory Map</a></h2>
<p>

This table describes all of the directories that are created under the
NaviServer installation directory when you install NaviServer. It lists
the files or types of files that are stored in each directory, the
configuration parameters that affect the directory or the files in the
directory, and references to where you can find more information on
the associated NaviServer features.

<p>


<h2><a name="security_guide">Security Guide</a></h2>
<p>


This chapter provides guidelines for ensuring the security of systems
running NaviServer. It describes the issues that must be considered and
the associated modifications that should be made to NaviServer
installations.


<p>


<h3><a name="general_nsadmin_passwords">General nsadmin Passwords</a></h3>
<p>


<p>


By default, the nsadmin password for NaviServer is either set to NULL
or to a poor password. Set an acceptable password for nsadmin as
described below.


<p>


Edit the nsadmin entry in the /modules/nsperm/passwd file. For
example, the default passwd file contains this nsadmin entry:
 nsadmin:CUdnvgBYocLSI:::::


<p>


Substitute an alternate encrypted password in place of CUdnvgBYocLSI.


<p>


To encrypt a password, you can copy an already-encrypted password from
the /etc/passwd file or run the bin/nspasswd utility. It will prompt
you for a password and return the encrypted version of the password.


<p>


For more information about the passwd file, see the &quot;Defining Users&quot;
section.


<p>


<h3><a name="permission_settings">Permission Settings</a></h3>
<p>


<p>


It is more secure to avoid using the nsperm module and use file-level
security for ADPs. If you must use the nsperm module, set appropriate
permissions records as follows:


<p>



<ol>


<li> Maintain the same permission records for GET and POST; they
     actually provide the same permissions.

<br><br>
<li> Remove any permission records related to network publishing (PUT,
     DELETE, MKDIR, and BROWSE) for all users except nsadmin.

<br><br>
<li> Keep in mind the inheritance rules for permission records. In
     general, a permission record for a directory also applies to the
     directories underneath it.

</ol>



<p>


To define NaviServer permissions, create permission entries for them in
the perms file, which resides in the /modules/nsperm directory. The
default perms file does not contain any permission entries, but it
contains comments that explain how to add entries to the file.


<p>


For more information about setting permissions, see the &quot;Permissions&quot;
section.


<p>


<h2><a name="recommended_security_modifications">Recommended Security Modifications</a></h2>
<p>


The actions described in this section are recommended, but not
required, to ensure the security of systems running NaviServer.


<p>


<h3><a name="naviserver_version">NaviServer Version</a></h3>
<p>

In general, NaviServer versions 4.99 and higher should be used whenever
possible, because they are more secure than earlier versions of
NaviServer.


<p>


<ul>

<li> NaviServer can be run in a chroot environment.

<br><br>
<li> The configuration file, which has a new Tcl format, is executed in
     a separate, temporary interpreter that is destroyed before startup
     begins. The configuration file memory buffer is then zeroed after
     parsing.

<br><br>
<li> The nsd binary can be stored outside the root directory because
     NaviServer no longer locates and re-executes itself.

<br><br>
<li> The configuration file can be stored outside the root directory,
     because NaviServer opens and reads the configuration file before
     running chroot().

<br><br>
<li> The nscp module, which allows connections only from localhost,
     provides a secure control port interface that allows ad hoc Tcl
     evaluation and other server administration features. For more
     information about the control port interface, see the &quot;NaviServer's
     Control Port Interface&quot; section.

</ul>



<p>


<h3><a name="secure_chroot_environment">Secure chroot Environment</a></h3>
<p>

NaviServer should be run in a secure chroot() environment whenever
possible.


<p>


In Versions 4.99 or higher, NaviServer supports a -r command line option
to run NaviServer in a chroot() environment. It provides the following
benefits:


<p>


<ul>

<li> The chroot() system call updates the process such that all
     absolute filenames are relative to a new root directory instead of
     the actual mounted file system.

<br><br>
<li> The chroot() call is irrevocable. Once chroot() returns, the
     server cannot access any file above the new root directory.

<br><br>
<li> Although it does not actually protect any of the underlying
     content, scripts, or protected databases, chroot() is the single
     most effective tool for protecting the server machine and
     sensitive information, such as user passwords and configuration
     files, from view.

</ul>



<p>


To run NaviServer in a chroot() environment, you need only copy a few
files and directories to the new root directory. For example, on the
SGI platform, you would execute the following commands to create new
directories and copy the necessary files to them:


<p>


mkdir $root/dev $root/tmp $root/etc


<p>


chmod 1777 $root/tmp


<p>


cd $root/dev; /dev/MAKEDEV generic usema


<p>


cp /etc/passwd /etc/resolve.conf $root/etc


<p>


Then, you can run NaviServer with the -r option as in this example:
 nsd -t nsd.tcl -r $root


<p>


For more information about the nsd command line, see the &quot;NaviServer
Command Line&quot; section.


<p>


<h3><a name="restricted_content">Restricted Content</a></h3>
<p>


Determine whether any of the content available to an NaviServer in a
chroot() environment would be restricted. In general, NaviServer should
be read-only and everything it can read should be world-readable. This
allows the NaviServer administrator to ignore the nsperm module
altogether.


<p>


If any of the content available to NaviServer is restricted, the
NaviServer administrator needs to define the appropriate permissions
with the nsperm module. The administrator should be very clear which
areas are blocked off and know both the URL and METHOD for the
restricted areas.


<p>


It is preferable to allow the GET method for all URLs and have nothing
restricted accessible through NaviServer.


<p>


<h3><a name="tcl_library">Tcl Library</a></h3>
<p>

Limit the available Tcl functions to just those functions that are
necessary by that particular NaviServer installation. Purge the Tcl
library of unnecessary functions. For example, if the site doesn't
send e-mail, remove the ns_sendmail procedures.


<p>


Some potentially unsafe commands you may want to consider removing
are:


<p>


<ul>

<li> File system related functions, such as open, read, and puts

<br><br>
<li> The NaviServer ns_sock* Tcl functions

<br><br>
<li> The Tcl socket routines

<br><br>
<li> The exec command

<br><br>
<li> The file command, or at least the delete and rename features

<br><br>
<li> The exit command

</ul>


<p>


This code example disables the open command:


<p>



<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>

static int
AddCmds(Tcl_Interp, void *arg) {
    Tcl_CreateCommand(interp, &quot;open&quot;, BadCmd, NULL, NULL);
    return TCL_OK;
}

static int
BadCmd(ClientData dummy, Tcl_Interp *interp, int argc, char **argv) {
    Tcl_AppendResult(interp, &quot;disabled command: &quot;, argv[0], NULL);
    return TCL_ERROR;
}

</pre></td></tr></table></p>


<h3><a name="stacksize">Stacksize</a></h3>
<p>

Apart from the specific details of integration of your favoured language you may have to take a look at
the stacksize parameter of your config file.

<p>
As a rule of thumb the default stacksize (in bytes)

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
#
# Thread library (nsthread) parameters
#
ns_section &quot;ns/threads&quot;
ns_param   stacksize 65536 ;# Per-thread stack size.

</pre></td></tr></table></p>

is almost always not enough. Use multiples of 1024 and increase to 1 Megabyte for the start:

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>

#
# Thread library (nsthread) parameters
#
ns_section &quot;ns/threads&quot;
ns_param   stacksize 1048576 ;# Per-thread stack size.

</pre></td></tr></table></p>

If the size of the stack is not enough you may encounter crashes without real explanation. 

<h3><a name="database_access">Database Access</a></h3>
<p>

Database access should be restricted with read-only logins to the
server and queries through stored procedures.


<p>


For more information about the Tcl functions for stored procedures,
see the &quot;ns_db&quot; section of the NaviServer Tcl Developer's Guide. For
more information about the C functions for stored procedures, see the
&quot;Stored Procedure Functions&quot; section of the NaviServer C Developer's
Guide.


<p>


<h3><a name="control_port_interface">Control Port Interface</a></h3>
<p>

The control port interface should not be used unless absolutely
necessary. Although it is more secure than the /NS/Admin interface
from earlier NaviServer versions because it only allows connections
from localhost, it still poses a risk potential.


<p>


For more information about the control port interface, see the
&quot;NaviServer's Control Port Interface&quot; section.
