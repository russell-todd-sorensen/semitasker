<h2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p>

This function does the same permission check that the NaviServer does before serving
a URL. If the nsperm module is loaded, the algorithm is as follows. See Chapter 6 in
the Naviserver Administrator's Guide for information on access control, including permissions.

<ul>

<li> If the authuser is &quot;nsadmin&quot;, the password is correct, and the IP
          address of the client is allowed nsadmin access, then access is authorized.

<br><br>
<li> Find the relevant permission record. If an exact match for the method and URL
         combination is not found, the end of the URL is pared down until a match is found.
         For example, if there is no match for `/products/cereals/raisin_bran.html,' then
         the server looks for a permission record for the URL `/products/cereals.' If that
         permission record is specified as &quot;Exact URL match is NOT required&quot;, then that
          permission record is used.
</ul>

<p>
By default, the server comes with a row that says GET on `/' is open to the world.

<p>
If no relevant permission record is found, access is denied (forbidden).

<ul>

<li> If the authuser is in the &quot;Allow Users&quot; list, access is permitted. If the authuser
         is a member of a group in the &quot;Allow Groups&quot; list and not in the &quot;Deny Users' list,
          access is permitted.

<br><br>
<li> If the host is in the &quot;Hosts to allow&quot; list, access is permitted. If the host
         is in the &quot;Hosts to deny&quot; list, access is denied.

<br><br>
<li> If the request does not come in with authorization data, access is denied.

<br><br>
<li> The user and password are verified. If there is no password specified in the database,
         any password is accepted.

<br><br>
<li>  Otherwise, access is denied.

</ul>

<h2><a name="return_values">RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
<p>

The following values can be returned by ns_requestauthorize.

<ul>

<li> OK The user has permission to execute this URL and method.
<br><br>
<li> DENIED The user does not have permission to execute this URL and method.
<br><br>
<li> FORBIDDEN There is no possible user/password/IP Address combination that would give authorization.
<br><br>
<li> ERROR There was an error.

</ul>
