<h2><a name="access_control">Access Control</a></h2>
<p>


<p>


NaviServer allows you to define users and groups of users, and assign
permission records to individual pages or entire page hierarchies.
NaviServer users are distinct from operating system users. A permission
record lets you allow or disallow lists of users, lists of groups, and
lists of hosts for a method and URL combination.


<p>


NaviServer requires one special user, nsadmin. This user is always
allowed access to any URL on an NaviServer. The nsadmin user is similar
to the Unix root user.


<p>


NaviServer is configured by default with the nsadmin user, a system
group, a public group, and a users group.


<p>


You can change the permissions given to the system, public, and users
groups and assign users to them by following the procedures described
in this chapter.


<p>


 <h2><a name="users_and_groups">Users and Groups</a></h2>
<p>


<p>


NaviServer users are identified by short user names. These user names
can be any name you choose; they are completely independent of the
Unix login accounts. New users can be assigned subdirectories of the
NaviServer pages directory where they can store content.


<p>


 <h2><a name="defining_users">Defining Users</a></h2>
<p>


<p>


To define NaviServer users, you need to create entries for them in the
passwd file, which resides in the /modules/nsperm directory. The
default passwd file contains:


<p>

&quot;&quot;::::::

<p>

nsadmin:CUdnvgBYocLSI:::::

<p>

nobody::::::


<p>


The format is the same as the format for the /etc/passwd file.
NaviServer ignores all but the first two fields, which are the user
name and the encrypted password. The password itself is encrypted the
same way as Unix passwords.


<p>


The &quot;&quot; user is the unauthenticated user and is treated the same as any
other user.


<p>


 <h2><a name="defining_groups">Defining Groups</a></h2>
<p>


<p>


To define NaviServer groups, you need to create entries for them in the
group file, which resides in the /modules/nsperm directory. The
default group file contains:


<p>



<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>


system:::nsadmin
users:::nsadmin,nobody
all:::nsadmin,nobody,&quot;&quot;
public:::&quot;&quot;


</pre></td></tr></table></p>



<p>


The format is the same as the format for the /etc/group file.
NaviServer ignores all but the first and last fields, which are the
name of the group and a comma-separated list of users in the group.


<p>


The default group file, shown above, creates groups called system,
users, all, and public, with the listed users in each.



<p>


 <h2><a name="permissions">Permissions</a></h2>
<p>


<p>


Permission records indicate the allowed access for a particular URL
and method (GET, and PUT). GET access to an URL allows the user to
display the page, or submit information in a form. PUT access allows
the user to write to the page or delete the page.


<p>


Once you have defined authorized NaviServer users and groups, you can
maintain NaviServer permission records. Normally, only nsadmin and
users in the system group can set permission records directly.


<p>


 <h2><a name="permissions_inheritance">Permissions Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>


<p>


To simplify the permission structure and reduce the number of
permission records you need to maintain, you can specify that a
permission record is inherited by more specific URLs. For example, a
permission record for /a/b would be inherited by /a/b/c.htm if there
is no specific permission record for /a/b/c.htm.


<p>


 <h2><a name="setting_permissions_for_users_and_groups">Setting Permissions for Users and Groups</a></h2>
<p>


<p>


To define NaviServer permissions for users and groups, you need to
create permission entries for them in the perms file, which resides in
the /modules/nsperm directory. The default perms file does not contain
any permission entries, but it contains the following comments, which
explain how to add entries to the file:


<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>


# This is the NaviServer perms file which defines which users
# and groups may or may not visit certain URLs.
#
# The format is:
# ACTION  INHERITANCE  METHOD  URL  ENTITY
#
# ACTION can be: denygroup, allowgroup, denyuser, or allowuser
# INHERITANCE can be: inherit or noinherit
# METHOD can be: PUT, GET, POST, or any other supported method.
# URL is the path relative to pageroot, e.g., /index.html or
# /images
# ENTITY is either the name of a user or group, as specified in
# the passwd and group files.
#
# Example:
# denyuser  inherit GET /NS &quot;&quot;
# allowuser inherit GET /NS nsadmin

</pre></td></tr></table></p>



<p>


 <h2><a name="allowing_hosts">Allowing Hosts</a></h2>
<p>


<p>


You can specifically allow hosts to log in as certain users. The
hosts.allow file, which resides in the /modules/nsperm directory,
allows you to specify which hosts may log in as certain users. The
default hosts.allow file contains:



<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>


#
# This is the NaviServer hosts.alow file. It allows you to specify
# which hosts may log in as certain users. If you have an entry
# in this file for a given user, you may not have an entry in
# hosts.deny for that same user.
#
# Example:
#
# nsadmin: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0, .internal.mycompany.com, home.me.com
#

</pre></td></tr></table></p>



<p>


The format for entries in the file is:


<p>

username: host, host, host ...


<p>


where username is a user defined in the passwd file and host can be
specified in either of these forms:


<p>

<ul>

<li> ipaddress/netmask


<br><br>


  For example, a host specified as 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 matches any
 IP address that begins with 10.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> a fully-qualified host name


<br><br>


  For example, foo.bar.com.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> part of a host name


<br><br>


  For example, .bar.com, which would match anything ending in
 .bar.com.


</ul>



<p>


Any user in this file must be coming from one of the listed addresses
to gain access.


<p>


 <h2><a name="denying_hosts">Denying Hosts</a></h2>
<p>


<p>


You can specifically deny hosts from logging in as certain users. The
hosts.deny file, which resides in the /modules/nsperm directory,
allows you to specify which hosts cannot log in as certain users. The
default hosts.deny file contains:


<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>


#
# This is the NaviServer hosts.deny file. It allows you to specify
# which hosts may not log in as certain users. If you have an
# entry in this file for a given user, you may not have an entry
# in hosts.allow for that same user.
#
# Example:
#
# nsadmin: hacker.badguy.com, .aol.com, 10.2.114.0/255.255.255.0
#

</pre></td></tr></table></p>



<p>


The format for entries in the file is:


<p>


username: host, host, host ...


<p>


where username is a user defined in the passwd file and host can be
specified in either of these forms:


<p>


<ul>

<li> ipaddress/netmask


<br><br>


  For example, a host specified as 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 matches any
 IP address that begins with 10.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> a fully-qualified host name


<br><br>


  For example, foo.bar.com.


<br><br>


<br><br>
<li> part of a host name


<br><br>


  For example, .bar.com, which would match anything ending in
 .bar.com.


</ul>
