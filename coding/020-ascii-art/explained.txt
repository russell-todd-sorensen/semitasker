ASCII Art is usually produced without programming,
but sometimes with a little bit of programming things 
can be more easily done.

The program utilizes loops to produce identical lines of art.

Only a very simple approach was used here, note that lines
a == aa 
b == bb 
c == cc 
d == dd 
e == ee

and

tip == stem

These could have been combined, but the resulting code would
have been more complicated. Instead the strings were copied 
and renamed.

Also, if the repeat was 1 this might have just been assumed as a
default and not set the counts in the default case (very often).

The answer takes up less than half the vertical space and is easy 
to debug.
