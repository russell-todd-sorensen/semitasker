<title>LeetCode 30-Day Challenge: Day 1</title>
<!--
First Bad Version
You are a product manager and currently leading a 
team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the 
latest version of your product fails the quality 
check. Since each version is developed based on 
the previous version, all the versions after a 
bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and 
you want to find out the first bad one, which 
causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) 
which will return whether version is bad. 
Implement a function to find the first bad 
version. You should minimize the number of 
calls to the API.

Example:

Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version.
