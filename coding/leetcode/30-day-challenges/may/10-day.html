Find the Town Judge
In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There 
is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town 
judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] 
representing that the person labelled a trusts the person 
labelled b.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the 
label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.

 
Example 1:

Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Example 4:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: -1
Example 5:

Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
Output: 3
 

Note:

    * 1 <= N <= 1000
    * trust.length <= 10000
    * trust[i] are all different
    * trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
    * 1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N

Find the Town Judge

In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There 
is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town 
judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

    * The town judge trusts nobody.
    * Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town 
      judge.
    * There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 
      1 and 2.

You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] 
representing that the person labelled a trusts the person 
labelled b.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the 
label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.

 
Example 1:

Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Example 4:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: -1
Example 5:

Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
Output: 3


Note:

    * 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000
    * trust.length &lt;= 10000
    * trust[i] are all different
    * trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
    * 1 &lt;= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] &lt;= N


/**
 * @param {number} N
 * @param {number[][]} trust
 * @return {number}
