    Each List item is composed as a tuple:
    Item = (both, value).
    All other variables are temporary,
    we have to maintain the value of the previous
    pointer (prev) to construct the value of both when
    we initially create the list item.

    However, the value of the previous both has to
    be updated when we add the next item to the list.
