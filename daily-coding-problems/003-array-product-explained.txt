    input = [a,b,c,d,e]
    0 = [1,b*c*d*e] [-,  1-4]
    1 = [a,  c*d*e] [0,  2-4]
    2 = [a*b,  d*e] [0-1,3-4]
    3 = [a*b*c,  e] [0-3,  4]
    4 = [a*b*c*d,1] [0-4,  -]

    Every output index can be expressed as the product two numbers.
    These two numbers are the product of elements to the left
    of the index and those to the right of the index. These two
    numbers can be built up in such a way that at most only three
    multiplications need to be done for each output index.

    In the example with 5 elements total
    multiplications = 2*0 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 5 = 13
                   == 2*(n-1) + n == (3n - 2)

    Time complexity is O(n)

    An additional easy way to validate your code is to submit a list
    with one element set to zero. This will return zeros everywhere
    except the index which held the zero.
