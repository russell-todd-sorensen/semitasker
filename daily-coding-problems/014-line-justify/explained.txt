Once the number of characters plus a space between
each word is greater than the line length, the last
word is discarded.
The total number of characters plus necessary
whitespace equals the line length.
Total whitespace is divided by the number of gaps
(words -1) to get the minimum whitespace between words.
If the remainder is zero, spacing is even across
the line. Otherwise the minimum is just between the
last and next-to-last words. The remainder (%) is added
to the remaining whitespace and divided by the remaining
words. If the remainder ever hits zero, the remaining
words can be joined with the same spacing.
