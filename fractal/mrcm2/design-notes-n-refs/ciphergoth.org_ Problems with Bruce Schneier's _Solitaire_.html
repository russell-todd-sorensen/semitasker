      Solitaire bias</p>
<h1>Problems with Bruce Schneier's "Solitaire"</h1>
    
<p> Readers of Neal Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon" will be
    familiar with the cipher "<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/solitaire.html">Solitaire</a>"
    (called "Pontifex" in the book), which was designed by
    cryptologist Bruce Schneier specifically for the purposes of
    the book. It is intended to be the first truly secure hand
    cipher, and requires only a pack of cards for encryption and
    decryption.</p>

    
<p> As yet, the technical information about the design of the
    cipher has not been made available, but I decided to go
    investigating, and I've now written a fast "C" implementation
    of the cipher suitable for collecting statistics about the
    CPRNG at its heart. I have found two interesting facts:</p>

    
<ul>
      
<li>The CPRNG state machine is <em>not</em> reversible,
      contrary to what the operational notes claim: the initial
      step in which a joker is moved to the top if it is on the
      bottom cannot be reversed. This is surprising since
      non-reversible CPRNGs tend to have shorter periods and can
      more easily exhibit bias.</li>

      
<li>And indeed, the output of the CPRNG is very biased. The
      output of each step of the CPRNG is a number from 0 to 25;
      you would expect successive outputs to be the same around one
      time in 26, but my experiments show that the frequency is
      closer to 1/22.5.</li>
    
</ul>

    
<p> I'm making the source code for the tests I ran available to
    the public domain. Note that the problems reported in earlier
    versions are not present in this version; it turns out that it
    was only my development version that had the problems anyway
    and the one available for download was fine.</p>

    
<ul>
      
<li>
<a href="http://www.ciphergoth.org/crypto/solitaire/c-sol.c">C implementation of Solitaire</a>,
      optimised to perform both cuts in a single copying step; on
      my machine I can generate 10^7 samples in 20 seconds.</li>

      
<li>
<a href="http://www.ciphergoth.org/crypto/solitaire/perl-sol">Perl implementation of Solitaire</a>
      modified to do coincidence counting and take the same user
      interface as the C version, though of course the C version is
      about 250 times faster. This is useful for debugging and
      verifying the C version.</li>

      
<li>
<a href="http://www.ciphergoth.org/crypto/solitaire/normal.c">Normal distribution probability
      calculator</a>, for when your statistical significance gets
      so high you fall off the end of your normal tables.
      Unfortunately, the significance of the bias I've detected in
      Solitaire (passphrase CRYPTONOMICON, 9999999 samples, 444745
      coincidences) falls off the end of what this program can
      calculate, at 98.87 standard deviations from the mean...</li>
    
</ul>

    
<p> I believe I now know the main reasons why this bias arises:
    when the value of the top card is the same in two successive
    rounds, an event you would expect to occur with probability
    just under 2%, the probability that the output letter is also
    the same is very high, around 34%. This is I assume because
    when this happens it's likely that many other cards are also in
    the same positions across the rounds. This isn't the sole
    source of the bias but it's by far the largest component. Below
    is the output from my latest version of c-sol, instrumented to
    measure the correlations between "coincidences" (two successive
    outputs being the same) and "top matches" (the value of the top
    card being the same on two successive rounds); everything it
    measures shows some bias, so there's more to be found than what
    I've discovered so far.</p>

<strong>Update 2001 August 13:</strong> Frans Lategan made
    <a href="http://www.ciphergoth.org/crypto/solitaire/lategan-1.txt">an interesting observation</a> on the
    movement of the jokers in Solitaire, which I hadn't spotted
    until now.</p>

    
<p> I'm interested in designing a secure hand cipher; <a href="http://www.ciphergoth.org/crypto/mirdek/">my first attempt, Mirdek</a> turns out
    to be very insecure, but I return to the problem from time to
    time.</p>
