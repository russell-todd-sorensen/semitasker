replacing inline styles:

triggering synthetic events to simulate user interaction:

initialize scroller and with synthetic events skip 'focus' lag event:

(Note to above): When pointer moves over element listening for scroll
events, the first scroll event just shifts focus to the element.
Code above does this as soon as scroller enters element, skipping
the one event lag.

Also from above: using script tag with type set to something not javascript
creates a template storage. Shows how to use this.
