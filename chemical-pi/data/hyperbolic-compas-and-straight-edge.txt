Compass and Straightedge in the Poincaré Disk

For over 120 years, tesselations of the hyperbolic plane have 
appeared in mathematical journals and books, in the art of M.C. 
Escher, and as interesting graphic images on posters, buttons, etc. 
Though dozens of books have been published on the analysis underlying 
such tesselations, it appears that there has not been one single 
article describing the synthetic techniques actually used to make 
them. We show how a "hyperbolic compass and straightedge" can be 
constructed with the usual Euclidean compass and straightedge; that is,
given any two points in the Poincaré disk model (or the other well-known models), 
one can give a simple Euclidean construction for the geodesic through 
the two points, or for the hyperbolic circle centered at one, passing 
through the other. Moreover, there is a beautiful duality between 
geodesic/points inside the disk and points/lines outside the disk. This 
duality is extremely helpful in the construction of tesselations; it 
appears to have been discovered many times over the last 120 years, and 
was certainly the basis for such images as M.C. Escher's Circle Limit prints.
