   <h2>History of World Tartans</h2>
   <p>Tartan has a long and fascinating history. The word itself probably derives
   from tiretaine, a French word for a type of woollen fabric, although the Gaelic
   breacan (specckled, chequered) is more descriptive. Its origins are highly
   controversial, however. Some historians have identified the earliest known tartan
   as a small, 3rd-century fragment of cloth, which was found near the Antonine Wall
   (see Falkirk, page 99), but this was an isolated find. It is far from clear when
   clansmen began to adopt the custom of wearing tartan.</p>
   <p>There is some evidence to suggest that the earliest setts were district rather
   than clan, tartans. When Martin Martin made a tour of the the Hervrides in the
   1690s he noted <q>the fine plaids of divers colours</q> but linked them with places
   rather than with people.</p>
